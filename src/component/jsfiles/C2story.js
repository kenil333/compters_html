            <p className="testimonials__storysection__text1">Hari started business of flavoured foxnuts in 2017 and he used to do books for his business himself. He thought taking professional help would be expensive. Hari realised that their books are messed up and regularly accounting workflows are not maintained. Hari and his team approached us 6 months back and asked us if we could help them with their books. We happily agreed.</p>
            <p className="testimonials__storysection__text1">Hari also needed help with understanding cost structure, fixing sale price, different operating/financial metrics. The first thing we did was to fix their books and updated it which is the base work. It is needed for any further financial planning/analysis. We prepared updated Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, and then we did number of models for the business to help the team understand the financial situation of the business. The Team was very confident with the way they were negotiating contracts with suppliers, customers, etc.</p>
            <p className="testimonials__storysection__text2"><span style={{fontSize: '30px'}}>"</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our understanding of financial statements and simplifying different numbers into relavant reports have helped Hari and his team in their business. We thank Hari and his team for this opportunity.</p>
