            <p className="testimonials__storysection__text1">Payal runs a bike store in San Antonio,Texas and approached us for Bookkeeping for her firm. The business was in a very nascent stage and they had a bookkeeper who used to help them but they faced issues of having consistent and reliable financials ready on time. We understood their business, cleared all the backlog, and are helping them keep their books updated regularly.</p>
            <p className="testimonials__storysection__text1">After the books were updated and consistent , she also asked us if we could help her understanding the financial situation of the business and help in understand different numbers. We were delighted for this project and helped us thru our finance services. We helped them with the following models:</p>
            <p className="testimonials__storysection__text1"><span className="testimonials__storysection__text1__span1">1.</span> <span className="testimonials__storysection__text1__span2">Revenue Cost structure analysis :</span><br/>It involves segregating fixed, variable, and semi-variable costs and how they moved along with different periods. It helped them in knowing various things like how much they are spending on various marketing initiatives and what is helping them more, how and when could they achieve break-even, etc.</p>
            <p className="testimonials__storysection__text1"><span className="testimonials__storysection__text1__span1">2.</span> <span className="testimonials__storysection__text1__span2">Comparative Sales & Margin breakup analysis :</span><br/>This model indicates how much amount is spent on different things in a business from every dollar earned. It is prepared over a different period which helps in knowing what factors are impacting margins more and how costs are changing across different periods.</p>
            <p className="testimonials__storysection__text1"><span className="testimonials__storysection__text1__span1">3.</span> <span className="testimonials__storysection__text1__span2">Scenario Analysis :</span><br/>This model makes sense for a business with fixed and semi-variable costs. We prepared a profit/loss with major revenue and cost items with different levels of annual/monthly sales. It helped them in understanding how benefits of fixed costs will accrue once they achieve scale, and helped them in setting business targets.</p>
            <p className="testimonials__storysection__text2"><span style={{fontSize: '30px'}}>"</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our understanding of financial statements and simplifying different numbers into relavant reports have helped Payal and her team in their business. We thank Payal and her team for this opportunity.</p>
